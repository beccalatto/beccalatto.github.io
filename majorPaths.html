        <h2>Applied Math</h2>
        <p>Brief Overview: Applied mathematics deals with the use of mathematical concepts and techniques in various fields of science, technology, and engineering. The applied mathematician is interested in problems coming from other fields, in the formulation and solutions of these problems, and in the interpretation of the results. Their work frequently overlaps with that of other scientists and engineers.</p>
        <p>Career paths include: Graduate and professional schools, risk management, consulting, government agencies, technical, manufacturing, and financial industries</p>

        <h2>Applied Physics</h2>
        <p>Brief Description: The applied physics program stresses the basic physics that underlies most
        developments in technology and engineering and the mathematical tools that are important to both physicists and engineers. Since the advances in most branches of technology lead to rapid changes in state-of-the-art techniques, the applied
        physics program provides the student with a broad base of fundamental science and mathematics while retaining the opportunity for specialization through
        technical electives. Research areas include fusion and space plasma physics, optical and laser physics,
        condensed matter physics, and nanophysics.</p><p>Career paths include: Graduate and professional schools, risk management, consulting, government agencies, technical, manufacturing, and financial industries</p>

        <h2>Biomedical Engineering</h2>
        <p>Brief Description: Biomedical Engineering is a discipline that advances knowledge in engineering, biology, and medicine — and improves human health through cross-disciplinary activities that integrate the engineering sciences with the biomedical sciences and clinical practice. Bioengineering/Biomedical Engineering combines engineering expertise with medical needs for the enhancement of health care. It is a branch of engineering in which knowledge and skills are developed and applied to define and solve problems in biology and medicine.</p>
        <p>Career paths include: Biomedical engineers develop devices and procedures that solve medical and health-related problems; do research to develop and evaluate systems and products such as artificial organs, prostheses (artificial devices that replace missing body parts), instrumentation, medical information systems, and health management and care delivery systems; design devices used in various medical procedures, imaging systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and devices for automating insulin injections or controlling body functions.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Engineering</h2>
        <p>Brief Description: Chemical Engineering enables the production of useful and essential chemicals and materials by processes that require controlled physical, chemical, or biological transformations. The Chemical Engineer guides the passage of the product from the laboratory to the marketplace, from ideas and prototypes to functioning articles and processes, from theory to reality. This expertise is essential to production, marketing and application in areas such as pharmaceuticals, high performance materials in the automotive and aerospace industries, semiconductors in the electronics industry, paints and plastics, consumer products, petroleum refining, industrial chemicals, synthetic fibers, and bioengineering and biotechnology areas from artificial organs to biosensors.</p>
        <p>Career paths include: The Chemical Engineering degree is a passport to exciting careers in directly related industries as diverse as biochemical engineering,environmental management, and pharmaceuticals, and graduates launch careers in medicine, law, management, banking and finance, and politics. Chemical engineers can be found in industry in fields as diverse as fuels, electronics, food and consumer products, pharmaceuticals, environmental engineering, and pulp and paper.</p>
